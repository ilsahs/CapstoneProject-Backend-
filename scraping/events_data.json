        "description": "A favourite Omani recipe, 'shuwa' is a dish of slow–cooked marinated lamb. The meat is coated in a flavourful rub of spices, garlic and oil, although exact recipes and spices used vary from region to region. It is traditionally cooked, wrapped and buried in a pit of hot coals for several hours –producing the most tasty dishes owing to the resting stage when the marination of the meat allows the juices to properly absorb and thereafter cook perfectly.",
